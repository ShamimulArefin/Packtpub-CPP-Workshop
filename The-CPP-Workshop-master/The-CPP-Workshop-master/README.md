We use online compilers to compile code in The C++ Workshop. The compiler at [cpp.sh](http://cpp.sh/) is extensively used in this Workshop. However, you can also use one of the following compilers:
1. [Tutorialspoint C++ compiler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_cpp_online.php)
2. [godbolt compiler explorer](https://godbolt.org/)
3. [coliru](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/)
4. [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/cpp)
5. [Rextester](https://rextester.com/)

## About The CPP Workshop
You already know you want to learn C++ development, and a smarter way to learn C++ 11 is to learn by doing. [The CPP Workshop](https://www.packtpub.com/programming/the-c-workshop) focuses on building up your practical skills so that you can develop high-performance software applications or even your own independent games with effective modern C++. You'll learn from real examples that lead to real results.

## What you will learn
* Get to grips with fundamental concepts and conventions of C++ 11
* Learn about best practices for clean code and how to avoid common pitfalls
* Reuse and reduce common code using the C++ standard library
* Debug and compile logical errors and handle exceptions in your programs
